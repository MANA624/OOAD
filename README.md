This is the repository for Matt Niemiec

My repo has a very simple structure. Each homework has its own folder, and inside that folder is the PDF I submitted, as well as a sub-folder containing the Intellij project that has all of my source code in there. I plan on using Java for the time being, but will note if that changes. However, I am NOT a Java expert - I in fact have minimal Java experience. So, I'm not sure what the best format to give you the code is, so I leave all the source code in the /src folder and the classes in the /out folder. Please let me know if you'd like a different submission format, and I'll be happy to accommodate
