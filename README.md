This is the repository for Matt Niemiec

My repo has a very simple structure. Each homework has its own folder, and inside that folder is the PDF I submitted, as well as a sub-folder containing the Intellij project that has all of my source code in there. I plan on using Java for the time being, but will note if that changes. However, I am NOT a Java expert - I in fact have minimal Java experience. So, I'm not sure what the best format to give you the code is, so I leave all the source code in the /src folder and the classes in the /out folder. Please let me know if you'd like a different submission format, and I'll be happy to accommodate

UPDATE: On homework 2 I decided to use Python 3. The change I made is commented in the code, but basically I made the printing method abtract, so as to allow an implementation at the subclass level. Then the subclass can print a unique message when it is called, but still allow the actual shape itself to be printed by the superclass' method. I opted to do this instead of creating another subclass variable to print out in order to 1) Demonstrate the useulness of abstract classes, and 2) It felt more Pythonic, since you can't just declare protected variables in your abstract class. So that was the engineering decision I felt I needed to change.
